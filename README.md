# sloa.dk
sloa.dk was a dying project and is no longer available. This was it's codebase though.

This has been a long going hobby project - a personal portfolio site. 

The site never got out of Alpha state before I started a second [site](https://github.com/Stickano/Portfolio), which has taken even longer.

Perhaps some day in the far future this will actually become a complete project.

All the documentation for this project is in Danish. The site is mainly PHP and is done in functional pratice. 
Check out the [second](https://github.com/Stickano/Portfolio) (codebase) version of sloa.dk which uses OOP instead.
